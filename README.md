# closestPairProblem
This Python code uses the math and matplotlib libraries to find the minimum distance between a set of 2D points and visualize the closest pair. It implements the divide-and-conquer algorithm to efficiently solve the problem by recursively dividing the set of points into halves until the base case of two points is reached.
